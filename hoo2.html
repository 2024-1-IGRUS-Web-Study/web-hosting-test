    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <P>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document 
        management system accessed over the Internet. It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.
    </P>
    <P>
        The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application 
        called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
